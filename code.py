Okay, I need to solve this problem where given a number a between 10 and 999, I have to output 1 or 0 based on some condition. But wait, what's the condition? The examples show that 13 gives 1, 927 gives 1, and 48 gives 0. Hmm, I need to figure out what's the pattern here. 

Let me look at the examples again. Let's see:

First example input 13 outputs 1. Second, 927 also 1. Third, 48 is 0. What's different between 13 and 48? Maybe it's about the digits. Let me think of possible conditions.
