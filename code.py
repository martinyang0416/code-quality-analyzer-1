Okay, I need to solve this programming problem where the input is an integer a between 1 and 30, and the output is another integer. The example given is input 3 outputs 27. Let me think about what's going on here. 

Hmm, 3 cubed is 27. Oh right! So maybe the problem is to compute a cubed? Let me check. If that's the case, then the output is simply a multiplied by itself twice. So for any input a, the output is a^3. 

Wait, but let me make sure there's no trick here. The problem statement is shor
