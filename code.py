Okay, let's see. The problem is to take an integer a between 1 and 30 and output some result. The example given is input 3 outputs 27. Hmm, 3 cubed is 27. So maybe the problem is to compute a cubed? Wait, but let me think again. Because maybe there's a trick here. Let's see other possibilities. Like, perhaps the output is the sum of numbers up to a? No, 3 would be 6. Or factorial? 3! is 6. Not 27. So 3^3 is 27. That fits. So maybe the task is just to compute a cubed. 

But why would the problem
