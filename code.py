Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's see what the question is. The input is an integer a between 0 and 35, and I have to output another integer. The examples given are when input is 3, output is 8, and input 10 gives 1024. Hmm, let's think about what's going on here.

Wait, 3 gives 8. 8 is 2^3. Oh right! And 10 gives 1024 which is 2^10. Oh! So maybe the problem is to compute 2 raised to the power of a. That seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

So the task is simply t
