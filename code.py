Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the question carefully. The input is an integer a between 0 and 35, and I have to output another integer. The examples show that when the input is 3, the output is 8, and for 10 it's 1024. Hmm, what's the pattern here?

Wait, let's think about exponents. For the first example, 3 gives 8. Oh, 2^3 is 8. Then 10 would be 2^10 which is 1024. Oh right! So the problem is to compute 2 raised to the power of a. So the output is 2^a.

But wait, m
