Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's see what the question is. The input is a single integer a between 1 and 30, and the output should be another integer. The example given is when the input is 3, the output is 27. Hmm, 3 cubed is 27. So maybe the problem is to compute a cubed? But wait, let me think again. Maybe there's another pattern here. Let me check if there are other possible interpretations.

Wait, the example fits with a^3. Let's see: 3^3 is 27. So perhaps the task is s
